- The enemies are not very good at getting the player, so to check the win condition, it may be better to manually set ```Life > amount``` to be zero
- Movement is WASD, but the player glides around very smoothly so it might be tricky (sorry)
- You can click to shoot and see that the enemies will die. To win, you must kill all enemies.
- There is a win screen that has an ellipsoid and a lose screen that has a capsule.

# HW2: Chapters 1, 2, 5, 6
