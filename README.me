# HW2: Chapters 1, 2, 5, 6
- You may notice some extra GameObjects floating around (one of the "challenges" to create a room, etc.)
- My work is in `SampleSene`
- The bulk of this assignment had to do with adding movement and bullet firing. This behavior was implemented in `Enemies > Moving Flying Enemy`
    - The relevant scripts are in the `Assets > Scripts` folder
    - You can use usual WASD keys to move and the mouse to rotate (the sensitivity on my Mac was quite low)
